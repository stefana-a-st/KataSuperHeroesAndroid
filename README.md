![Karumi logo][karumilogo] KataSuperHeroes for Android. [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataSuperHeroesAndroid.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Karumi/KataSuperHeroesAndroid)
============================

- We are here to practice UI Testing.
- We are going to use [Espresso][espresso] to interact with the Application UI.
- We are going to use [Dagger2][dagger2] to replace production code with [Test Doubles][testDoubles].
- We are going to practice pair programming.

## Getting started

This repository contains an Android application to show Super Heroes information:

![ApplicationScreencast][applicationScreencast]

This Application is based on two Activities:

* ``MainActivity`` showing a list of super heroes with name, photo and a special badge if is part of the Avengers Team.

![MainActivityScreenhot][mainActivityScreenshot]

* ``SuperHeroDetailActivity`` showing detailed information about a super hero like his or her name, photo and description.

![SuperHeroDetailActivityScreenshot][superHeroDetailActivityScreenshot]


The application architecture, dependencies and configuration is ready to just start writing tests. In this project you'll find  ``Dagger2`` configured to be able to replace production code with test doubles easily and Espresso to be able to interact with the application user interface.
